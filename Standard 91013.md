A Hurricane, Cyclone or Typhoon is defined as a rotating, organized system of clouds and thunderstorms that originate over tropical or subtropical waters, with a closed, low-level circulation.

In the above diagram, it is shown that tropical storms tend to form in equatorial areas above a large area of water.

This illustration from NASA shows the pattern of wind movement globally, indicating that the sun heats air over the equator more than it would at the poles. This difference causes hotter, less dense air to rise, forming convection currents which at the surface generate wind. These are referred to as Hadley Cells.

The above shows data gather from between 1985 and 2005, detailing the movement of all tropical cyclones between this period. As evidenced by these maps, cyclones often form between the equator and tropics, then continue moving towards their closest pole.

Using the 3 images above, we can form a solid hypothesis as to how and why tropical cyclones might form. Being somewhat related to the fundamental principles of convection, taking into consideration that air would recieve more heat at the equator, than at the poles.

## How Tropical Cyclones form

Tropical cyclones form when warm, moist air rises, creating an area of low pressure near the surface. Air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure push into the low pressure area to fill in the space, and that too heats up, rising. As the warm air cools, the water condenses to form clouds, as the wind spins fed by the heat from the ocean to continue rising air. The spinning of a cyclone is caused by a natural phenomenon known as the Coreolis Effect. Because at the center of a cyclone there is a low pressure area, often called the eye, with areas of higher pressure surrounding this, air attempts to make its way to the eye. When this happens, the difference in rotation causes the air to be deflected to one specific direction on all sides; to the right in the northern hemisphere and left in its southern counterpart. This results in a vortex movement.
Tropical cyclones will lose energy as they travel over land or toward the poles, as heat or water volume decreases over these areas.
